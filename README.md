# Huskies Club Site

This is an effort to rebuild [`the club's original vanilla html website`](https://github.com/HuskiesComputerClub/Huskies-Website) using the [`sveltekit`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) framework. As for the app's responsiveness design strategy, we will follow a [mobile-first approach](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#working-mobile-first). Components should be imported strictly from the [DaisyUI package](https://daisyui.com).

## Motivation:
To start working together on software asynchronously. I will create tasks as issues so members can choose how to participate. The issues are meant to be a learning experience. Each issue will have a readiness level. The assignee has should know they have room for creativity. 


## Developing

First install dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev -- --open
```
To view your work on mobile viewer right click anywhere on and press the inspect option

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
